### All assets used in this proyect are either original or free of use. 



I made this proyect to learn the basics of game-making and distribution, as well as libraries like SDL-3 in C++ and how to use Git.

Features: you can move the character with the A & D keys, it will also display a console window for logs, the window is also resizable.




### To use the proyect, either compile from source with the CMake file, which is intended for VS Code, or [download a release and use the installer](https://github.com/K1rtash/game_sdl-cpp/releases/tag/indev).
