### All assets used in this proyect are either original or free of use. 


I made this proyect to learn the basics of game-making and distribution, as well as libraries like SDL-3 in C++ and how to use Git.

In the game you can move the character with the A & D keys, it will also display a console window for logs.



## To use the proyect, either compile from source with the CMake file, which is intended for VS Code, or download a release and use the installer.
